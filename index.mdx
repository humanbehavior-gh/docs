The Human Behavior SDK allows you to record user sessions and track behavior analytics in web applications for use with the Human Behavior platform.

<Warning>
  **Important:** By using the HumanBehavior SDK, you agree to comply with our [Terms of Service](https://organic-panther-09d.notion.site/Human-Behavior-Terms-of-Service-1d785c32eb888021a5fefa9732fddd97) and [Privacy Policy](https://organic-panther-09d.notion.site/Human-Behavior-Privacy-Policy-1d785c32eb8880b98336cd9059fb9d42).
</Warning>

## Quickstart

<Note>
  If you are using a framework such as React, NextJS, or Vite, we recommend using one of our [Framework Guides](/frameworks/frameworks) instead of the quickstart.
</Note>

The fastest way to get started is by adding a simple JS snippet at the top of your website.

### Step 1: Get your Public API Key

This will help identify your website to Human Behavior when users visit it.

<Info>
  <b>How to find your Public API Key:</b> Project Home → Settings (on sidebar) → Public API Key
</Info>

<img
  src="/images/APIKey.png"
  alt="Where to find your Public API Key"
  style={{ borderRadius:"0.5rem",margin:"1rem 0",maxWidth:"100%" }}
/>

<Note>
  <b>Security Best Practice:</b> Store your API key in environment variables rather than hardcoding it in your source code. This prevents accidental exposure of your key in version control.

  <Expandable title="example">

  ```bash
  # .env
  HUMANBEHAVIOR_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
  ```

  ```javascript
  // In your code
  const tracker = HumanBehaviorTracker.init(process.env.HUMANBEHAVIOR_API_KEY);
  ```

  </Expandable>
</Note>

### Step 2: Install the Tracker

#### Option 1: CDN

Add this to the top of your file.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/humanbehavior-js@latest/dist/index.min.js"></script>
```

#### Option 2: Package Manager

Install using `npm`, `yarn`, or your package manager of choice.

```bash
npm install humanbehavior-js
```

### Step 3: Add the tracker to your project

```html
<head>
	<!-- your other metadata here -->
	<script>const tracker = HumanBehaviorTracker.init('YOUR_API_KEY_HERE');</script>
</head>
<body>
	<!-- your website content here -->
</body>
```

### Simple HTML Example

Here is a simple HTML website using the CDN version:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Website</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

    <!-- Load the HumanBehavior SDK -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/humanbehavior-js@latest/dist/index.min.js"></script>

    <!-- Initialize the tracker -->
    <script>const tracker = HumanBehaviorTracker.init('your-api-key');</script>

  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My App</h1>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

<Note>
  **That's it\!** The SDK automatically tracks user interactions, navigation, and console events. You don't need to add any custom event tracking unless you want to track specific business events. See [Custom Events](/essentials/custom-events) for more information.
</Note>

## Browser Compatibility

The SDK supports all modern browsers:

| Browser | Version |
| ------- | ------- |
| Chrome  | 60\+    |
| Firefox | 55\+    |
| Safari  | 12\+    |
| Edge    | 79\+    |

<Warning>
  Internet Explorer is not supported. The SDK uses modern JavaScript features that are not available in IE.
</Warning>

## Bundle Size

The SDK is optimized for size:

- **Core SDK**: ~45KB (gzipped)
- **With React integration**: ~50KB (gzipped)
- **CDN version**: ~60KB (gzipped)

<Note>
  <b>Best Practice:</b>

  Always initialize the tracker in the <code>\<head\></code> section, before any user interaction can occur. This ensures all events—including those on page load—are captured.
</Note>

## What Happens Next?

Once you've completed the setup:

1. **Automatic Session Recording**: The SDK automatically captures user interactions using rrweb
2. **Automatic Event Tracking**: Button clicks, link clicks, and form submissions are tracked automatically
3. **Session Persistence**: Sessions persist across page reloads for 30 minutes
4. **Navigation Tracking**: SPA navigation and URL changes are automatically tracked
5. **Console Tracking**: Console logs, warnings, and errors are captured
6. **Data Processing**: Events are processed and sent to your dashboard
7. **User Identification**: Users are automatically identified using cookies
8. **Analytics**: View session recordings and analytics in your HumanBehavior dashboard
